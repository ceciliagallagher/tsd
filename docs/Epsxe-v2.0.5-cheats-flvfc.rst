  Hi guys, i was wondering if ePSXe version allowed use of action replay codes for cheats. Or is it strictly gameshark? I made this basically for me, but maybe someone else finds it useful too. At first I disliked the need to click twice to open the cheats. Unfortunately it just works with EPSXE v and its freezing with original hardware. EDIT: its work fine need good redump game.
