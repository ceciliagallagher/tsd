Can you possibly recommend a funny/silly but competent rom hack? Something that's kinda different, even. i really like rom hacks like Drayano's Blaze Black and the like where they introduce every pokemon into the game and increasing the.

All the Drayano hacks are top tier. BB2/VW2 are my favourite. Hold off on Sacred Gold/Storm Silver cause he's developing a rehash of those hacks. Pokemon Gaia. Any of the Kaizo hacks if you're into that sorta stuff. I personally don't enjoy playing kaizos. As someone commented above, SORS is next on my list, heard a lot of good things about it. I'm looking for a nice pokemon ROM, but I can't find one. I do not have the ability to download game files, so it's got to be a no-download ROM. One more thing that I'm looking for is a dystopian plot. I'm a huge fan of both pokemon and the dystopian genre, and it'd be amazing to see a dystopian pokemon ROM that I can play. 7 pokemon dark realm - it is a rom hack of ruby with some fakemons (custom pokemon) and a cool story pokemon dark realm is just beautiful you should definitely play it. 8 pokemon light platinum - it is a hack of ruby it is a very old hack but it is still good as it was the starting of rom hack it has many things do also like world championship.
